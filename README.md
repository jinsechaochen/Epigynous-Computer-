# A Supervisory Control Program for Delta Robots
Build Environment:
This project was successfully built and runs normally under Qt 5.15.13 + MinGW 32-bit.

Program Overview:
This software is designed to integrate with a lower-level controller (slave device) for Delta robotic arms. It implements key functionalities including:

Serial communication
Jogging/inching control
Movement along predefined trajectories
Trapezoidal acceleration/deceleration profiles
Automatic path planning based on start and end coordinates
Note:
‚ö†Ô∏è This is my first project after learning Qt, and the hexadecimal data transmission implementation is quite rudimentary. I plan to refine it in the future when time permits. üòä
